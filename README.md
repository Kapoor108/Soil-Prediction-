# 🧠 Soil Detection Using Deep Learning

Welcome to the Soil Detection AI project! This is a smart image analysis system that detects **soil presence** in images using **unsupervised deep learning**. It’s designed to support **agriculture**, **environmental monitoring**, **robotics**, and other earth-science applications by classifying whether an input image contains soil or not — all without manually labeled datasets!

## 👋 Meet the AI Assistant

Imagine a model that doesn't need to be told what's not soil — it just *knows* what soil looks like and gets surprised when it sees anything different. That's exactly how this assistant works!

At its core, this project uses an **autoencoder-based anomaly detection approach**. It learns the "essence" of soil from pure soil images. Then, when shown a test image, it tries to reconstruct it. If it reconstructs well → **soil detected**. If not → probably **not soil**.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 📁 Dataset
- Grayscale images of soil.
- Resized uniformly to **128x128 pixels**.
- Only **soil images** are used during training — a classic **one-class learning** setup.

### 🏗️ Model Architecture
- A **convolutional autoencoder** built in **PyTorch**.
- Encoder learns to compress the image into a low-dimensional latent space.
- Decoder reconstructs the image from this compressed representation.
- Trained using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss.

### 🔄 Workflow
1. **Preprocessing**: Resize and normalize grayscale images.
2. **Training**: Only on soil images, for **20 epochs**, optimizing reconstruction loss.
3. **Prediction**:
   - Feed test image → Reconstruct it.
   - Compute **reconstruction error**.
   - If error < threshold → `soil`
   - If error ≥ threshold → `non-soil`

### 🧪 Evaluation
- Visualization of original vs reconstructed images.
- Histogram of reconstruction errors.
- Manually selected threshold for binary classification (can be tuned).

## 🌍 Why This Matters
This model can assist in:

🔬 **Precision Agriculture**  
   - Detect patches of land with and without soil.
   - Monitor health and presence of soil in drone images.

📡 **Environmental Monitoring**  
   - Track erosion, desertification, or deforestation effects over time.

🤖 **Robotics & Automation**  
   - Help ground robots identify terrain types in real-time.

🗺️ **Geospatial Analysis**  
   - Analyze satellite or aerial images to map soil distribution.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pandas matplotlib tqdm
````

### 🛠️ Run the Model

```bash
python train_autoencoder.py       # Train the model on soil images
python evaluate_model.py          # Run detection on test images
```

Make sure your `data/` directory is structured like:

```
data/
├── train/
│   └── soil_image_1.png
├── test/
│   ├── test_image_1.png
│   └── test_image_2.png
```

### 🧾 Output

* Reconstruction images saved in `results/`
* A `reconstruction_error.csv` with error values for each test image
* Final predictions labeled as `soil` or `non-soil`

## 📈 Customization & Next Steps

* 🔧 **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust the reconstruction error threshold for sensitivity.
* 🌈 **RGB Image Support**: Extend to color images with minor architecture changes.
* 📚 **Multi-Class Training**: Train to distinguish soil from other ground materials (e.g., grass, rock).
* 🧩 **Deploy as API**: Wrap the model in a Flask or FastAPI service to run predictions online.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

*The soil image dataset used in this project was custom-curated and preprocessed as part of the research work conducted during the IIT Ropar Summer Internship Program 2025. All training images consist exclusively of real-world soil textures captured or collected under controlled conditions to ensure dataset quality and consistency.

Thanks for exploring! Ready to help your camera *see* the soil, smarter and sharper.
